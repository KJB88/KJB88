<!--
Hello, my name is Kevin! I'm a Unity C# developer with over a decade of experience working in many different sectors! Most of my work has been NDA or IP owned by the company for their internal tooling, so my portfolio is a little bare outside of academic or personal projects!
You can find my portfolio here: [http://kjb88.github.io](http://kjb88.github.io).
Or you can find me at LinkedIn here: [http://www.LinkedIn.com/in/kevin-barr1988](http://www.LinkedIn.com/in/kevin-barr1988).
All of my links are on the left, below my profile image here on Github too.

My repositories are organized into different organizations to help keep things clean here.
You can find my: 
'A Game in a Day' challenge repos here: [https://github.com/KJB88-A-Game-in-a-Day](https://github.com/KJB88-A-Game-in-a-Day)
