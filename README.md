  <h2>Intro</h2>
  <p>Hello, my name is Kevin! Gamer. Cat-dad (x4). Mental Health & Disability Rights advocate.</p>
  <p>
I'm a Unity C# developer with over a decade of experience working in many different sectors! I have worked in academia, games, manufacturing developing Unity-based solutions as simulations, immersive experiences and entertainment. These have targeted many platforms such as PC/MAC, Android/iOS, VR HMDs, MR HMDs, Web. <br><br>Most of my work has been NDA or IP owned by the company for their internal tooling, so my portfolio is a little bare outside of personal projects!
