  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, my name is Kevin! Gamer. Cat-dad (x4). Mental Health & Disability Rights advocate. Creative Writer of absurdist parody.
  </p>
  <p>
  I'm a <b>Unity C# developer</b> with over a decade of experience working in many different sectors! I have worked in academia, games, manufacturing developing Unity-based solutions as simulations, immersive experiences and entertainment. I'm currently making a push into <b>Full-Stack Development</b> as a career switch, but using the knowledge I've learned to work on games on the side.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of my work has been NDA or IP owned by the company for their internal tooling, so my portfolio is a little bare outside of personal projects!
