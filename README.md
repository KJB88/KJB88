    <p>
      Hello, my name is Kevin! Gamer. Cat-dad (x4). Mental Health & Disability Rights advocate. Creative Writer of Absurdist Parody. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm laid-back, I love to joke and I absolutely love to learn more about people, especially those I work with or share my craft! If you ever want to talk about code, design, systems, games or cats (especially cats), I'm here and ready to talk your ear off!
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's some trivia about me:
      <ul>
        <li>I wrote a 100k+ word Epic about space clowns (it's still not finished...)!</li>
        <li>I built a successful (and most popular) game server (level design, story narrative, open-world, gameplay) within a private community around a niche MMO in the 00s.</li>
        <li>I love system architecure more than anyone should.</li>
        <li>My favourite game is Chrono Trigger.</li>
        <li>My dream is to open up my own games studio one day (and also fill it with cats).</li>
      </ul>

          <b>Full Stack Development</b>: I'm currently making a push into <b>Full-Stack Development</b> as a secondary career. I use my knowledge and perspective gained over my career working in the creative industry to drive my development in unique and innovative ways.

        Most of my work has been NDA or IP owned by the company for their internal tooling, so my portfolio is a little bare outside of personal projects!

  <section aria-label="Supplemental About Me">
    <h3>Supplemental</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Culture Ambassador</b>: I have taken initiative and approached leadership with recommendations on how to improve team-building, professional relationships and bridge the gap between workforce and leadership. This drive has been instrumental in allowing a friendly, close culture to grow, especially within remote working environments.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mental Health & Disability Rights Advocate</b>: In every role I take, I work to raise awareness about the challenges that professionals with disabilities, like myself, have to deal with on a daily basis. I work with my employers to provide recommendations on how to accommodate the additional support to allow my colleagues with disabilities to do our best work.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mentorship</b>: I regularly provide mentorship support to Junior, Student and Hobbyist developers in both a professional and personal setting. When working with an employer in a Senior or Lead position, my mentorship is part of my employment. However, in a personal setting I take time out of my day to check-up on colleagues, mentees or fellow hobbyists to ensure they're doing okay both professionally and personally.
